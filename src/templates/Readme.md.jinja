# SE Questions

The assembly of this list has been inspired by [Anthony Magnabosco](https://www.youtube.com/user/magnabosco210)'s occasional tweets with questions that may be useful when practicing [Street Epistemology](https://streetepistemology.com). My hope is that this list will help people with thinking of good questions in stressful situations. However, please consider carefully whether you want to bring the actual list to a conversation.

- PDF: coming soon!
- Flash cards: coming soon!

## Adding Questions

The easiest way to get a question added is probably to send me a message (e.g. via Twitter, where this all started; I'm [@lumpiluk](https://twitter.com/Lumpiluk)). The other way is to use Github's collaboration features.

For the latter option you'll want to clone this repository. Your question and source information goes to the end of the file se_questions.yaml. If you want, you can then run `make` in the terminal to compile the list into Markdown and PDF. This requires some dependencies, though:

- The program `make`, which in Ubuntu is included in the package build-essential
- Python 3
  - PyYAML for parsing YAML files, which in Ubuntu is included in the package python3-yaml
  - The Python templating engine Jinja2, which in Ubuntu is included in the package python3-jinja2
- A LaTeX distribution for PDFs and flash cards, e.g. TeX Live

## The Questions

{% for question in questions %}
{% if question.prompt %}
- (Source: [{{ question.source.link }}]({{ question.source.link }}))
  - *IL:* {{ question.prompt }}
  - *Q:* {{ question.question }}
{% else %}
- {{ question.question }} (Source: [{{ question.source.link }}]({{ question.source.link }}))
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
