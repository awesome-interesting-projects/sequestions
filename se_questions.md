# Questions

The assembly of this list has been inspired by [Anthony Magnabosco](https://www.youtube.com/user/magnabosco210)'s occasional tweets containing questions which may be useful when practicing [Street Epistemology](https://streetepistemology.com). My hope is that this list will help people think of good questions more easily in stressful situations. However, please consider carefully whether you want to bring the actual list to a conversation.

  - "I just know my God exists."
  - "Does it concern you in any way that a terrorist with a competing God belief would say the exact same thing?"
